            <h3>Project Title</h3><br>
            <p>Todo App: A Simple Task Management Tool</p>
        </div>
        <div class="divs">
            <h3>Project Overview:</h3><br>
            <p>The Todo App project is a straightforward yet effective demonstration of my proficiency in front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a basic task management tool allowing users to add, delete, and manage tasks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="divs">
            <h3>Objective:</h3><br>
            <p>The objective of this project was to build a functional and user-friendly todo application using fundamental web technologies. By creating this app, I aimed to showcase my skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, event bubbling, and event delegation in JavaScript</p>
        </div>
        <div class="divs">
            <h3>Technologies Used:</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML5</li>
                <li>CSS3</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>Bootstrap</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="divs">
            <h3>Features:</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Task Management:</b> Users can add new tasks to the list, delete tasks, and manage completed tasks.</li>
                <li><b>Dynamic UI Updates: </b> The application dynamically updates the task list in response to user actions, providing instant feedback and a seamless user experience.</li>
                <li><b>Event Bubbling and Event Delegation:</b> Event bubbling and delegation techniques are utilized to efficiently handle user interactions, reducing the number of event listeners and improving performance.</li>
                <li><b>Responsive Design: </b> The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal usability across various devices and screen sizes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="divs">
            <h3>Functionality Highlights:</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Adding Tasks:</b> Users can add new tasks to the list, delete tasks, and manage completed tasks.</li>
                <li><b>Deleting Tasks: </b> Tasks can be removed from the list individually by clicking a delete button associated with each task.</li>
                <li><b>Managing Completed Tasks:</b> Completed tasks can be deleted from the list using a dedicated option, providing users with a clutter-free view of their remaining tasks.</li>
                <li><b>Event Bubbling and Delegation:  </b>  Event listeners are strategically placed to leverage event bubbling and delegation, reducing the number of listeners and improving performance, especially in larger task lists.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="divs">
            <h3>Challenges:</h3><br>
            <p>One of the main challenges faced during the development of this project was efficiently managing user interactions and updating the UI while maintaining code simplicity and performance. Additionally, implementing local storage functionality required careful handling of data serialization and deserialization.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="divs">
            <h3>Solutions:</h3><br>
            <p>To overcome these challenges, I employed event bubbling and delegation techniques to streamline event handling and minimize the number of event listeners. By structuring the code to leverage event propagation, I was able to efficiently manage user interactions across the entire task list. Additionally, I optimized data storage and retrieval using browser local storage, ensuring seamless persistence of task data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="divs">
            <h3>Lessons Learned:</h3><br>
            <p>Through this project, I gained valuable experience in optimizing front-end performance and user experience through event bubbling, event delegation, and efficient data management. I learned the importance of leveraging browser features like local storage to enhance the functionality and usability of web applications.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="divs">
            <h3>Future Improvements:</h3><br>
            <p>In the future, I plan to enhance the Todo App by adding additional features such as task prioritization, due dates, and filtering options. Additionally, I aim to further optimize performance and accessibility, ensuring a seamless and inclusive user experience across different devices and platforms.</p>
